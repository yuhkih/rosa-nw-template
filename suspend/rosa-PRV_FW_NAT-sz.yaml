# The following will be deployed with this CF
# 1. Three subnets for each AZ. (Thins template is for single AZ)
# 2. AWS firewall deployed with a policy which allow all the domains listed on the ROSA document as prerequistes for egress.
#
# This template will create the following Network Firewall rules
#
#    1) {EnvironmentName}-DomainAllow-RuleGroup  based on ROSA requirments
#    2) {EnvironmentName}-ROSA-IP-Allow-RuleGroup  based on ROSA requiremnts (Splunk)
#    3) {EnvironmentName}-DomainAllow-RuleGroup-For-Application   For test perpose +  RHOAM (based on blocked logs)
#    4) {EnvironmentName}-IcmpAlert-RuleGroup    This crates alert when someone uses ICMP ping in VPC.
#    
# This deploys following network model
#   [Private Subnet] => [ FW Subnet] => [ NATGW(protected) Subnet] 
#   The model is based on the following AWS blog post.
#   https://aws.amazon.com/jp/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/deployment-models-for-aws-network-firewall-with-vpc-routing-enhancements/
#
#   [Notice!!!] This template can't rewrite default route entry of Natgateway subent "10.0.0.0/16   local " 
#               So, you need to change the entry after delploying this template like below.
#                Destionation    Target              Destination      Target
#               "10.0.0.0/16     local "   =====>   "10.0.0.0/16      fiewall-endpoint-id

# History 
# 2023/01/13 yuhkih Remove duplicated Output
# 2023/01/13 yuhkih add  "catalog.redhat.com" to FW for ?
# 2023/01/14 yuhkih Delete Ingress route table and make the order Private -> Firewall -> NatGw (Still you need to change NATGW route table manually) 
# 2023/01/14 yuhkih Added allow domains to setup an EC2 for Let's Encrypt (needed in case you put the EC2 in ROSA VPC)
#              - "dl.fedoraproject.org"          # Added to setup EC2 for Let's Encrypt
#              - "mirrors.fedoraproject.org"     # Added to setup EC2 for Let's Encrypt
#              - "d2lzkl7pfhq30w.cloudfront.net" # Added to setup EC2 for Let's Encrypt
#              - "epel.mirror.angkasa.id"        # Added to setup EC2 for Let's Encrypt
#              - "ftp.riken.jp"                  # Added to setup EC2 for Let's Encrypt
#              - "ftp.iij.ad.jp"                 # Added to setup EC2 for Let's Encrypt
#              - "supporters.eff.org"            # Added to setup EC2 for Let's Encrypt
# 2023/01/14 yuhkih Export Fierwall subnet id and route tabled id
# 2023/01/23 yuhkih Added "cloud.redhat.com" to FW # For cluster upgrading
# 2023/02/05 yuhkih Added a New FW Rule Group for RHOAM SMTP servers as a draft (If it's ok, transplant this into mz yaml)
#                   Changed the IP set name from SPLUNK_NET to SPLUNK_SERVERS. Apply SPLUNK_SERVERS to the rulegroup (before this, it was ANY. The list was not actually used)
#                   Changed the name of "{EnvironmentName}-SplunkAllow-RuleGroup" to "{EnvironmentName}-ROSA-IP-Allow-RuleGroup"
#                            Replace "SplunkAllowStatefulRuleGroup" with "ROSAIpAllowStatefulRuleGroup"
#                   Changed the name of "{EnvironmentName}-DomainAllow-RuleGroup" to "{EnvironmentName}-ROSA-Domain-Allow-RuleGroup" 
#                           Replace  "DomainAllowStatefulRuleGroup" with "ROSADomainAllowStatefulRuleGroup"
#                   Create "RHOAMDomainAllowStatefulRuleGroup". Moved RHOAM related domain to this group.
# 2023/02/06 yuhkih moved following domains from RHOAM to ROSA.
#                   - "aws.amazon.com"                    # RHOAM  =>  # ROSA installation (blocked logged but seems fine from co results and console)
#                   - "www.redhat.com"                    # RHOAM  =>  # ROSA installation (blocked logged but seems fine from co results and console)
#                   - "www.okd.io"                        # RHOAM  =>  # ROSA installation (blocked logged but seems fine from co results and console)
#                   - "access.redhat.com"                 # RHOAM  =>  # ROSA installation (blocked logged but seems fine from co results and console)
#                   - "observatorium.api.openshift.com"   # RHOAM  =>  # ROSA installation (blocked logged but seems fine from co results and console)
